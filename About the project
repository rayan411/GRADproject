The Context  :
● An application that helps graduate students create self-
educational paths that keep pace with the labor market.

● To bridge the gap between the requirements of the
labor market and the competencies of graduate
students.

Aims:
The main aim of this project is to develop an
application that helps the UJ students to create self-
educational paths, in order to support the University of
Jeddah vision programs, especially the “empowering
graduates’ program”, and to keep pace with the labor
market. It also bridges the gap between the requirements
of the labor market and the competencies of graduate
students. As a first stage, the proposed application will
cover most of the computer majors at the CCSE-UJ.



Programming Language and Tools:
This section represents the software and programming languages that
we used throughout the implementation phase of UJ bridge:

A-Visual Studio:
is an integrated development environment from
Microsoft, It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites
and web applications.

B- Flutter:
we used this framework to create apps on multiple platforms
such as IOS , Android , ect.

C-Dart:
Dart offers ahead-of-time compilations, which automatically
compiles code into a format that a native machine can easily read.

D-Firebase:
We used Firebase because it records logins and logouts in
the authentication field, and the Firestore field for recording users data,
path data, course data and source of course.

E- Pattern used (MVC):
(Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software
design used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic
